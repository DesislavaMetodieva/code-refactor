# Horiseon code refactor

## Description 

The goal for this project was to improve internal code by making many small changes without altering the code's external behavior. Refactoring improves code readability and reduces complexities. I made sure I used semantic html and added alt tags for better accessability and improvement the SEO of the page. I removed unnecessary parts such as duplications which also resulted in a code that uses less memory and performs faster. I followed the below guidelines:
1. Fixed defects separately
2. Avoid new features and functionalities. I tested the site every time after a change is made in html or css to make sure the s application behaviour is remains the same
3. Refactored only when it is practical
4. Understood the code and made comments whenever is needed for other colleagues
